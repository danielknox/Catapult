# Catapult

Additional files to help with the construction of the Catapult project from the book 'Home Robotics'

## Purpose of this Repo

Most of my experience comes from writing online content, I like this kind of environment as it's easy to rapidly update/adapt material. Sadly, a book is a much more static artifact and so, it is difficult to tweak things after the fact.

The purpose of this repository is to help provide you with additional support to help you make your robots - I'll try uploading useful information based on the questions being asked.

I hope that you find the additional material here useful and at times maybe clear up some possible confusion - if your really stuck, feel free to raise an issue and I will try to get back in touch with you as quickly as possible.
